onion.bingo
===========

``onion.bingo`` is a stupid quiz game written in Elm. It is made for fun and to
play a bit with Elm. In the quiz, you have to guess whether an article is from
The Onion or a real news article. The articles are scraped from
https://old.reddit.com/r/TheOnion/ and https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/.
You can play the game at https://onion.bingo.pyjam.as/. ``.bingo`` is a real
TLD and ``onion.bingo`` is available, but it is hella expensive. Enjoy!

This game was pair programmed with my friend Asbj√∏rn Olling :-)

------------

The logic of the game is in ``src/Main.elm``. Furthermore, there is a generated
data file called ``src/OnionData.elm`` that contains a list of all the articles
in the data set. ``OnionData.elm`` is generated by ``scrape.py``. Generally,
you only want to touch ``Main.elm``.

To develop, you need to install elm and git. First, clone the repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/carlbordum/onion.bingo

Then you can run elm::

    $ cd onion.bingo
    $ elm reactor

This will make the site available with live reloading at
http://localhost:8000/.
